**Prompt:**

Design a clean, modern desktop web UI for a “Gym Workout Tracker” app built for weight training. The layout should be a full dashboard page with three main zones: a top header, a left sidebar menu, and a main content area for today’s workout, exercises, sets, and history.[^3_6][^3_5]

1. **Overall style**
   - Minimal, flat design with soft card shadows, rounded corners (8–12px), and plenty of white space.
   - Color palette: dark background or off‑white surface, one strong accent color (electric blue or green) for primary buttons and highlights, neutral grays for borders and secondary text.
   - Use a single sans‑serif font with clear hierarchy: large titles, medium section headings, comfortable body text, large numeric values for sets, reps, and weight.[^3_9][^3_6]
2. **Top header bar (full width)**
   - Left side:
     - App logo or text logo: “GymTracker” or similar.
     - Small label: “Daily Strength Log”.
   - Center:
     - Today’s date (e.g. “Friday, 26 Dec 2025”).
     - Left/right arrow buttons to move to previous/next day.
     - A small calendar icon that opens a date picker.
   - Right side:
     - Simple user avatar or initials circle.
     - Optional icons: settings, light/dark mode toggle.[^3_5][^3_6]
3. **Left sidebar navigation**
   - Vertical sidebar with icons and labels.
   - Top: small logo icon.
   - Menu items:
     - “Today” (active/highlighted).
     - “Workouts” (for templates like “Back \& Biceps”).
     - “History”.
     - “Stats” (for progress charts, optional).
     - “Settings” (lower section).
   - Active menu item has a bold accent background or colored left border.[^3_4][^3_6]
4. **Main content layout (Today page)**
   Split the main content into two columns: a larger left column for the active workout and a narrower right column for summary and recent history.[^3_6][^3_5]

**4.1 Today’s workout header** - At the top of the left column: - Title: “Today’s Workout”. - Below, a workout selector row: - Label: “Selected workout:” - A pill‑style dropdown showing “Back \& Biceps” as an example. - Secondary pills for quick choices: “Chest \& Triceps”, “Legs”, “Shoulders”. - A subtle “+ Create workout” button to open a workout template creator.[^3_10][^3_9]

**4.2 Workout overview bar** - A horizontal info bar under the selector with key stats: - “Exercises: 5” - “Target sets: 20” - “Estimated time: 60 min” - Use small icons for dumbbell, clock, flame, etc.

**4.3 Exercise list card** - Large card titled “Exercises for Back \& Biceps”. - Top right of the card: primary button “+ Add Exercise”. - Inside the card, show a vertical list of exercise blocks. Each exercise block shows: - Exercise name (e.g. “Lat Pulldown”, “Barbell Row”, “Barbell Curl”). - Small chip showing muscle group (Back, Biceps). - “Add set” button aligned to the right.[^3_9][^3_10]

**4.4 Sets table for each exercise** - When an exercise is expanded, display a mini table for sets: - Columns: “Set \#”, “Weight (kg)”, “Reps”, “Notes/RPE”, and an action column. - Each row contains number inputs for weight and reps, a small text field for notes, and icons for marking complete or deleting a set. - Use clear borders or zebra stripes to separate rows. - Under the table: - Button “+ Add another set”. - Small quick‑adjust chips: “+2.5 kg”, “+5 kg”, “+1 rep”.[^3_10][^3_6]

**4.5 Primary actions for the day** - At the bottom of the Today card: - Large primary button: “Finish workout” (full‑width or aligned right). - Ghost/secondary button: “Save as draft”.

5. **Right column: summary and recent history**

**5.1 Daily summary card** - Card title: “Today’s Summary”. - Show key metrics with big numbers: - Total sets (e.g. “18 Sets”). - Total volume (e.g. “11,200 kg”). - Workout duration (e.g. “54 min”). - Include a simple horizontal progress bar for “Weekly workouts” (e.g. “3 / 4 sessions done”) with the accent color filling the bar.[^3_8][^3_6]

**5.2 Recent history card** - Card title: “Recent Sessions”. - Vertical list of last 3–5 days: - Each row shows date, workout name, and a short summary: “24 Dec – Back \& Biceps · 16 sets · 10,500 kg”. - Small “Open” link or icon to jump to that day.[^3_4][^3_10]

6. **Dedicated “Workouts” page (template manager)**
   - Grid or list of workout templates:
     - Card for each workout:
       - Name: “Back \& Biceps”.
       - Description: “Pull day workout focusing on lats and biceps”.
       - Small text: “5 exercises · 4 sets each”.
       - Actions: “Edit”, “Duplicate”, “Delete”.
   - “Create Workout” button at top right.
   - When editing a workout template, show a panel where the designer can add exercises, reorder them, and set target sets/reps for each exercise.[^3_3][^3_10]
7. **History page concept (for context)**
   - Simple monthly calendar or list.
   - Selecting a day highlights its workout and shows summary on the right.
   - Style consistent with Today page (cards, accent color, simple icons).[^3_5][^3_6]
8. **Micro‑details \& UX**
   - Use clear, touch‑friendly buttons and large click targets for inputs.
   - Keep forms short: adding a set should feel like 2–3 quick fields, not a big form.
   - Use subtle success states (small green check, mini toast “Set saved”) and error highlights.[^3_8][^3_6]

Generate this as a single, well‑structured responsive desktop dashboard page, focusing on clarity for logging sets, weight, and reps for strength workouts like “Back \& Biceps”.
